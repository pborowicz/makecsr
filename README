Directions by Paul Borowicz

Run this script:
create_csr_key.sh <name1> <name2>
 - you must specify the hostname or url assocated with the cert
	- you can specify up to 4, but you must specify at least one
	- generally you should do hostname and fqdn

Explanation of script:
	this populates the req.cf file in this directory and runs the appropriate
	openssl comand to generate a key and csr. They go in the folders with those names
	-keys : folder with all keys
	-csr : folder with all csr files (certficate signing request)
